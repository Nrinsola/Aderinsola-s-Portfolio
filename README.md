# Bitcoin Historical Data 

From January 2012 to March 2021, Bitcoin data at 1-min intervals from a few exchanges.
  For the period from January 2012 through December March 2021, content CSV files for specific bitcoin exchanges are available. They include minute-by-minute updates of the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), volume in BTC and the specified currency, and the weighted bitcoin price. Unix time is used for timestamps. Timestamps with no transactions or other activity have NaN values in their data fields. The exchange (or its API) may have been down, it may not have existed, or there may have been some other unanticipated technical problem in data reporting or collection if a timestamp is missing or if there are jumps. Every attempt has been made to eliminate duplicate entries and confirm the contents are correct and complete to the best of my ability, but obviously trust at your own risk.

# Cholera Outbreak, Stockholm, 1853

# Context 
This is a product of study on Stockholm's nineteenth-century history. 
Since Sweden's church archives are in good condition, it is possible to find out specific details on occurrences like pandemics. I'll begin this data collection by learning more about the significant cholera epidemic that occurred in late August 1853. Within a few weeks, 3% of the population had passed away. St. Catherine parish, one of the city's poorer neighborhoods, was particularly heavily impacted. 

# Content 
The information is gathered from manually compiled church records. Up until about 1870, the church was in charge of all population registration. The only data examined were death records. Since cholera has a 40% CFR, we may presume that there are more people who are afflicted yet survive. 


# Inspiration 
I'm hoping the data will be able to demonstrate the pace of a cholera pandemic in the 19th century in a city with very poor sanitation and the terrible consequences it had on society, along the with people.

# STORE SALES ANALYSIS

# Summary 

This report shows a breakdown of products sold over a two-year period in four (4) regions with eight (8) salespeople, According to the breakdown, sales in 2018 generated more money than they did in 2019. Additionally, accessories were the top-selling item overall, selling 16% more than apparel, the second-best-selling item, which sold 24.63% more. Texas generated the most income for the shop, totaling $532k, while New Mexico generated the least, totaling $493K across all five areas. The top-performing salespeople were Anna Weber and Laura Larsen, who each earned $276k, and Kim Fishman, who earned $232k,the salesperson who performs the worst. The most revenue was earned by Company S in 2018 with a total of $74K, while Company C earned the most in 2019 with a total of $64K. However, Company D reported the greatest aggregate revenue for the two years, $123K.

# Recommendations

Emphasis should be given to the best-selling item across the board, as this would increase customer happiness, sales, and money. A reward system should be in place to inspire and motivate sales staff to improve their performance and bring in more clients.
To increase sales, more money should be invested in low-revenue areas. Increased social media marketing and advertising can do this by raising target audience awareness.
